# Installation

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation

Stack Overflow data from 2017 was used to better understand about developers. 

The questions I was interested in were:

Is collaborating with remote peers harder than those on site?
What is the mostly used IDE?
Things which matter for Career Satisfaction


# File Descriptions

There are 3 notebooks available here which contains work related to the above questions. Each notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Libraries Used

For this project, I used pandas and numpy libraries to manipulate data easily for data analysis task.
Further, sklearn was used to aplit data, model data and calculate various metrics of the final model.

Matplotlib was mainly used for drawing graphs, for easy demonstration.

collections is used to access data structures for manipulating data.


# Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@cresclux/know-more-about-developers-a337d8047995).

# Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.
